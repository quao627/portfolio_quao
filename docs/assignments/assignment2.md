# Broad Application Goals

**Name**: Banana Foundry  
**Audience**: Aspiring entrepreneurs, current startup founders, company employees looking for part-time entrepreneurial opportunities, and students interested in innovation, with a focus on the Cambridge/Boston area. The app will initially target the MIT and Harvard community, including students, alumni, and affiliated individuals.  
**Value**: Banana Foundry focuses on fostering in-person connections, curating local entrepreneurial events, and facilitating meaningful collaborations. Users can discover co-founders, industry experts, and potential team members within their local ecosystem, combining interest-based networking with proximity for in-person meetups. Beyond standard networking, Banana Foundry provides tailored resources, mentor matching, and project boards for idea feedback, which are missing from broader social platforms.
