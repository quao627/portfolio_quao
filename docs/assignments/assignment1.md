# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

## Interview Plan

### Hunch/Theme
I want to explore how early-stage entrepreneurs, or those with an entrepreneurial spirit, use social platforms to connect with investors, co-founders, potential team members, and industry experts, and whether current tools meet their needs. My hunch is that existing platforms like LinkedIn may not fully address the specific challenges and communication needs of startup founders.

### Target Interviewees and Purpose
I plan to interview entrepreneurs at different stages and from various industries to understand their networking challenges and how they utilize social platforms. Additionally, I will interview individuals interested in entrepreneurship but who have not yet started, to understand how they seek to connect with like-minded people or join projects. The goal is to uncover gaps in current platforms and identify opportunities to enhance networking, especially in facilitating connections with key resources.

### Conversation Starters:
- **Background**: Can you tell me a bit about your entrepreneurial journey? What got you into it?
- **Challenges**: What’s been the hardest part of finding the right people to help you grow (e.g., co-founders, investors)?
- **Platform Use**: How do you use social platforms to make connections, and do they do the job?
- **Wish List**: If you could design the perfect networking tool for entrepreneurs, what features would it have?

## Interview Report

### Interview with Daniel
Daniel, a former senior software engineer at AMD, is now pursuing AI entrepreneurship, focusing on enterprise solutions. Despite his efforts with AI side projects, Daniel’s primary challenge is connecting with industry experts to validate market needs and feasibility. "I’ve tried using LinkedIn and Instagram, but they aren’t very effective," he explained, expressing frustration with the limited reach of these platforms. His current connections are too narrow to be truly representative of the industry.

Daniel prefers in-person meetings, particularly when evaluating potential co-founders, believing face-to-face interactions are crucial for assessing compatibility. He noted, "Group chats are just a filter to find the right people for offline discussions." Daniel also expressed a desire for a platform where entrepreneurs can share ideas and receive constructive feedback, similar to Reddit’s open critique model.

### Interview with Jason
Jason, a data specialist at a California-based startup focused on AI for mental health, brings a unique perspective as an early-stage team member. He’s enthusiastic about joining projects that solve meaningful problems, even though he’s not yet ready to lead a project himself. "If there’s a project solving a problem I care about, I’d love to help in any way I can," he said.

Jason actively seeks out discussions to deepen his understanding of mental health challenges and is interested in contributing to broader innovation efforts. He expressed a willingness to provide user research or early feedback on projects he finds compelling, particularly those related to his work. He sees value in a platform where people share entrepreneurial ideas and discuss solutions.

## Design Opportunities

### 1. **Spatial Proximity and Interest-Based Recommendations**
   - **Opportunity**: Entrepreneurs like Daniel want to connect in person, while also expanding their network beyond immediate connections. 
   - **Solution**: Enhance networking by combining spatial proximity with interest-based recommendations. This allows users to meet nearby for in-person events while discovering connections that align with their entrepreneurial goals through algorithm-driven suggestions.

### 2. **Project Boards and Interest-Based Discussions**
   - **Opportunity**: Entrepreneurs need a structured way to share business ideas and seek team members or co-founders, and also want broader discussions around industry topics.
   - **Solution**: Create two areas for collaboration: **Project Boards** for sharing ideas and finding collaborators, and **Interest-Based Discussions** for engaging in broader entrepreneurial conversations.

### 3. **Learning Hub with Mentorship and Resources**
   - **Opportunity**: Entrepreneurs like Jason seek guidance from mentors and resources to grow.
   - **Solution**: Develop a **Learning Hub** offering curated resources for different stages of entrepreneurship, along with a mentorship program where users can match with mentors based on specific needs.

### 4. **Activities Hub for Entrepreneurial Events**
   - **Opportunity**: Both interviewees stressed the importance of in-person interaction for effective networking.
   - **Solution**: Create an **Activities Hub** where users can discover relevant entrepreneurial events, workshops, or meetups, and filter them by location, type, or industry.
