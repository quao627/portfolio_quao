# Usability Criteria

## 1. Discoverability
I placed the main functions in the bottom navigation bar to help users quickly navigate the app, and I ensured the posts section is the first thing users see to immerse them in the community's activity. However, I realize that the process for creating posts might not be immediately obvious. Adding a dedicated "Create Post" button in the navigation bar would improve this and help users engage more quickly with content creation.

## 2. Efficiency
To enhance efficiency, I focused on consistent navigation throughout the app, making it easy for users to move between sections like posts, events, and chat once familiar. The "Register" button on event pages is clearly visible, allowing for quick sign-ups.

# Physical Heuristics

## 1. Situational Context
I designed the layout with the goal of keeping users informed about updates, such as new messages, reactions, or friend requests. A notification center could centralize these updates, ensuring users don't miss important interactions.

## 2. Accelerators
I also considered the needs of expert users, who might want to quickly find specific content. Adding a search bar that filters posts, users, and events would make navigation faster for those users, offering a shortcut to bypass casual browsing.

# Linguistic Level

## 1. Speak a User’s Language
I focused on using simple, clear language throughout the wireframe. Labels like “Create New Post” and “Who is going” ensure non-technical users can easily understand each section. Still, I think the language in areas like the "Post" screen could be improved. Instead of “Add Text,” a prompt like “Share your thoughts...” would feel more personal and engaging for users.

## 2. Information Scent
Lastly, I believe the profile section could benefit from prompting users to enrich their profiles when they’re incomplete. A subtle design element encouraging users to add more details would help them understand what's missing and create a more complete experience.
